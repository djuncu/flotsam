Alternative formulations
  - Extra term to enable better fit to phase function in backscatter direction
  - Option to pass asymmetry factor too
  - Option in fitting to set narrow lobe to zero

Interface
  - C++ interface
  - Fortran-90 interface
  - Easier extraction of additional information

Features
  - Best diffuse flux profile modelling, e.g. cubic
  - Gas absortion for near IR
  - Add appropriate ice shape and test

Internals

Testing
  - Aerosol benchmark
  - Check automatic differentiation
  - Check "classic" tssf method
  - Check in CAPTIVATE

Optimization

Completed
  - Why for low Rayleigh optical depths, does diffuse contribution to
    flux (from integrating over radiance distribution) appear to be
    too low by a factor of two, when comparing to two-stream flux
    (which matches DISORT)? - DONE
