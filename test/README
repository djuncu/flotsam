This directory contains a number of test scripts that run the test
program ../bin/flotsam.  The output of this program is described in
the top-level README file.  The scripts in this directory do the
following:

do_CAMS_benchmark.sh - Runs the CAMS intercomparison cases, producing
files with filenames similar to flotsamXXX_full_0.00_ss_0865nm_out.dat
indicating a full profile (rather than coarsened) with surface albedo
0.00, sea salt aerosol at wavelength 865 nm.  The full profile
consists of 49 layers, but faster performance may be obtained by
"coarsening" the profile, which can be done by editing the script and
uncommenting the MODE=coarse line near the top.  This merges the
top-most layers into one to leave 12 layers.

do_CAMS_benchmark_plots.sh - Very similar to the above but with
slightly different settings and more output angles to facilitate
plotting and comparison with DISORT. The DISORT reference calculations
are in the disort_reference directory.

do_timings.sh - Run FLOTSAM with profiles of an increasing number of
layers between 1 and 1000, and report the timings of direct and
Jacobian reflectance calculations. The output has three columns:
1. Number of layers
2. Average time of direct calculation in microseconds (averaged over 7280 profiles)
3. Average time of Jacobian calculation in microseconds (averaged over 729 profiles)
These times exclude the setup time.

The other scripts are for internal development purposes.
